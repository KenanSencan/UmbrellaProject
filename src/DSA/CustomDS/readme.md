The `CMakeSFMLProject/src/DSA/CustomDS` is for mimicking each basic data structure in C++. They are not as optimized and complex as the original data structures; however, the purpose of this folder is to be able to use any data structure easily when I'm solving a problem involving a data structure.

The folder contains sub folders for each data structure. Each folder contain custom cmake project files, one single header file for the entire data structure logic, one `cpp` executable and if necessary, benchmark header file.
